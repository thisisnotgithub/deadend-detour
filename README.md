Friendly help to novice developers and misguided visitors

Github contains about 1% of the source code in the world. Being that a proper (according to academic and industrial norms) software engineer never writes code that already exists, it's likely that searching for preexisting source code in only one location leads to failure.

If you've decided to start and end your search with Github, note that you are ignoring every developer working on these SCM networks:

  - CodePlex
  - BitBucket
  - Gitorious
  - Launchpad
  - Google Code
  - SourceForge

...and a few million unallied HGWeb and Gitweb project repositories.

Good luck in your search, and don't forget to never reinvent the wheel when writing new code!

Cheers,
Management
